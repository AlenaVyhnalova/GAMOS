            <h3>Modification of metal surfaces by helicenes for molecular sensing</h3>
            <h5>Supervisor: Ing. Jan Storch, Ph.D. <br>
                Expert Supervisor: RNDr. Jaroslav Žádný, Ph.D.</h5>
            <p>The aim of this Ph.D. thesis will be the synthesis, characterization, and chiral resolution of appropriate helicene derivatives for use in hybrid plasmonic nanostructures with a strong chiral response (Fig. 1). Such systems serve in the detection of small chiral molecules for direct determination of their absolute configuration or ee% in optically active mixtures [Ref. 2].</p>

            <h3>Synthesis of chiral helicene-based polymers</h3>
            <h5>Supervisor: Ing. Jan Storch, Ph.D. <br>
                Expert Supervisor: Mgr. Illia Panov, Ph.D.</h5>
            <p>The aim of this Ph.D. thesis will be the synthesis, characterization, and chiral resolution of appropriate helicene derivatives and the study of their polymerization: via chemical way; via electrosynthetic approach [Ref. 3]. (e.g. in Fig. 2) or via coordination with transition metals (MOFs). Simultaneously, the chiroptical properties of newly prepared chiral polymeric materials will be intensively studied.</p>

            <h3>Preparation of polyaromatics for molecular optoelectronics</h3>
            <h5>Supervisor: Ing. Jan Storch, Ph.D. <br>
                Expert Supervisor: RNDr. Jaroslav Žádný, Ph.D.</h5>
            <p>The aim of this Ph.D. thesis will be the synthesis and characterization of appropriate helicene/phenacene derivatives for the preparation of their functional layers and their study. Such systems can serve in electrochemical detection [Ref. 1]. (e.g. in Fig. 3) or as active layers in OLED devices.</p>
