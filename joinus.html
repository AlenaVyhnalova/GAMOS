            <h3>Application of microwave photochemistry in the preparation of polyaromatics</h3>
            <h5>Supervisor: Dr. Ing. Vladimír Církva</h5>
            <p>The proposal is based on the connection of two scientific disciplines: traditional photochemistry and recently developed microwave chemistry when the effect of UV/Vis and microwave radiation on the chemical and physical properties of molecules are studied. The required radiation is generated completely atypically directly by the microwave field using so-called electrodeless discharge lamps. The aim of the project is basic research and optimization into the influence of microwave radiation on the course of cis-trans photoisomerization and photocyclization of stilbene and o-terphenyl derivatives, leading to phenanthrene, triphenylene, phenacene, helicene analogues or their N- and S-hetero derivatives, which may find application in molecular electronics.</p>

            <h3>Preparation of phospha-nanographenes</h3>
            <h5>Supervisor: Ing. Jan Storch, Ph.D.<br>
                Ing. Tomáš Beránek, Ph.D.</h5>
            <p>π-Conjugated organophosphorus systems have become the subject of intensive research in recent years, mainly due to their use in material chemistry. The presence of the phosphorus atom in the molecule facilitates its further derivatization whereas effectively changing some key characteristics of the target molecules and their intended application. A special place in this class of substances is occupied by six-membered phosphacycles. Although considerable progress has been made recently in the synthesis of these substances, polyaromatic compounds with an incorporated phosphinine ring are still rare. As part of this study, synthetic routes enabling the introduction of the phosphinine core into nanographene structures will be investigated. The properties of these compounds will be further studied.</p>

            <h3>Heteroaromatics-based Organic Radical Batteries</h3>
            <h5>Supervisor: Ing. Jan Storch, Ph.D. <br>
                Expert Supervisor: Prof. Ing. Zdeněk Sofer, Ph.D. (UCT Prague)</h5>
            <p>Unlike the well-known Li-ion batteries, ORBs (Organic Radical Batteries) were first developed in 2005 and their popularity continually has grown since then. The advantages of ORB over Li-ion cells include shorter charging time, longer life, higher capacity, lower working temperature, and environmental friendliness. However, when developing organic electrode materials, problems such as low ion mobility and weak conductivity must be solved. Among redox-active materials, heteroaromatics, such as daiza[n]phenacenes represent a unique group of molecules that undergo two one-electron reductions and at the same time, they are strong electron acceptors. This makes them interesting electrode materials whose development will be addressed in this Ph.D. work.</p>
